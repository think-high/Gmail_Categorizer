On Chemistry Crowds CAPTCHAs and Cats

The Nobel Prizes were announced this past week here at Kaggle were particularly psyched about the one for Computational Chemistry In a kindred spirit of using prizes to spur innovation and achievement we have a few laureates of our own to announce


GE Flight Quest Phase 2 Winner

The Milestone prize for Flight Optimization goes to Kaggle newcomer id aka Roman Prokopenko from Moscow Roman received his PhD in 2005 from MIPT Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology State University in the field of physics and mathematics He is currently working for the Russian Academy of Sciences at the Institute of Higher Nervous Activity and Neurophysiology In his own words I started Flight Quest 2 for fun Machine learning is one of my majors and my younger brother is a pilot

The Kaggle team has been busy prepping the Flight Simulator for the next part of the competition Check back next week for Simulator v2 and a fresh data set and leaderboard


BattleFin Big Data Combine

The prize for Algorithmic Trading goes to Kaggle Master BreakfastPirate aka Steve Donoho The comp ended with some wild swings between the public and private leaderboards  and you can read more about its outcome on this forum thread It was also covered recently in the NYTimes Dealbook blog This was a tough problem and although the top finishers may not all be experts in finance they certainly are in cross validation!


311 Hackathon Results

And finally the prize for awesome performance in a 24hour Hackathon goes to James Petterson who has been making a habit of medaling in these shortformat competitions Special thanks to sponsor SeeClickFix and David Eaves for putting up the prize money and Microsoft for providing the venue

Even if you missed the kickoff event theres still a chance for fun and glory The deepdrive continuation of the competition will run until November 27th


More Recently Launched Competitions

Appropriately enough given that some of the top Kaggle performers hail from the Russian Federation we are teaming up with Yandex to host the Personalized Web Search Challenge  the 8th such challenge organized by Yandex since 2004 In previous years participants have tried to learn to rank documents to predict traffic jams to find similar images to predict the relevance of documents using search logs and to detect search engine switchings in search sessions This year participants are asked to rerank URLs of each search engine results page according to the personal preferences of the users The Challenge is a part of the Web Search Click Data workshop WSCD2014 and the reports from the best teams will be presented at a workshop to be held at WSDM 2014 conference on February 28 2014 in New York The workshop is organized by Pavel Serdyukov Yandex Georges Dupret Yahoo! and Nick Craswell Microsoft ResearchBing


Partially Sunny with a Chance of Hashtags

We are excited to team up with the CrowdFlower platform on the first of what we hope will be many fun machine learning projects that demonstrate how online crowds can be used for both brute force and finesse CrowdFlower is debuting a new open data library and were always looking for an excuse to have a competition Why is this exciting? Sweet sweet Labels  the secret sauce that transforms bitter raw data into the ambrosia of algorithms In fact the competition prize is $500 worth of CrowdFlower credits to label your next data set

Introducing Playground Competitions

You may have already read the announcement on No Free Hunch but in short its what happens when a machine learning person starts a sentence with

  Wouldnt it be cool if somebody found the eigenvectors of a
  I bet you ten bucks this data could be used to
  Hold my beer Im going to see if

First up in the Playground is Dogs vs Cats In this competition youll write an algorithm to classify whether images contain either a dog or a cat This is easy for humans dogs and cats Your computer will find it a bit more difficult which is why the task was once used as a CAPTCHA However the current literature and the initial leaderboard! suggests machine classifiers can now score above 80% accuracy on this task Can you beat the state of the art?

On a slightly more serious note you can choose to contribute to the prize pool of this competition which will be donated to the ASPCA or an animal charity of the winners choosing 2nd place gets a stuffed Boo origin story of that prize can be found here

Thanks for responce

Hello and warm greetings
We thank you for your active participation in Manthan a Citizens for Accountable Governance CAG initiative Through your engagement with Indias biggest youth movement so far you have helped us collectively voice our opinion to the political establishment on 14 national challenges We provided a platform for ideas from our youth to be heard by Indias policy makers that they can take forward and construct a healthier future of India
And our future lies in the hands of Indias biggest workforce 90 Million men  women who feed 125 Billion of us Indian farmers are in distress One farmer commits suicide every 30 mins And we want to stop that 
Our movement Samvaad aims to pursue the Government to stop it Through Samvaad we aim to create the Worlds Largest Petition to be presented to the Prime Minister of India
You can sign the petition by clicking here
Were also assembling a team of Samvaad Ambassadors who will be instrumental in creating this movement If youre interested or want to refer someone click here
If youd like to join CAG or stay updated on our future initiatives click here

If you resonate with this vision of ours we would like to invite you to take the first step by filling a form atwwwindiancagorgjoincag
